● In-memory storage: Tasks are kept in an array (data will reset when the server restarts).
● Endpoints:
1. GET /to-dos → Returns all tasks.
2. POST /to-dos → Adds a new task with a unique ID.
3. DELETE /to-dos/:id → Deletes a task by its ID.
This demonstrates basic CRUD operations:
- Create → Add a task
- Read → View all tasks
- Delete → Remove a task
